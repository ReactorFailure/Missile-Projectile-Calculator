You can always press the `Hint` button to find these credentials anytime.

### Launching the missile
To launch your missile, you will need to input values into the text fields. After inputting the fields, you will then have to press the `Update` button then press the `Launch` button.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The text fields will NOT accept negative numbers. You do not need to put a negative number for the gravitational acceleration.
> The angle of launch text field accepts numbers from 1-89. Gravitational acceleration accepts numbers from 1-15, while the rest of the text fields accept numbers from 1-100

After launching the missile, the calculated result will show on the text area on the bottom of the window.
